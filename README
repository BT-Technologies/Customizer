Customizer v3.0.5

       * Enhanced DEB package post-installation scripts
       * DEB package now depends on gambas packages greater then 2.0 and lower then any 2.9
       * DEB package now depends on x11-xserver-utils
       * /usr/bin/customizer uses sh instead of bash to execute the GUI, initiates faster
       * Fixes applied so when WORK_DIR is path with spaces everthing woks fine
       * QEMU.sh also initiated as root, needed to chroot to get variables
       * QEMU.sh checks for running X-server (Xorg)
       * Squashed filesystem no longer created with "-all-root", causes dbus issues and probably more
       * Changing WORK_DIR not possible in the middle of customization
       * Dbus should work fine, mounting /var/lib/dbus and /var/run/dbus for running X applications (sessions and package managers) from within the chroot
       + Added Software-Center to supported package managers (doesn't work if Distribution name is changed)
       + DEB package creates menu entry for window managers (such as Fluxbox, Openbox etc.)

       * Removed not needed "#!/bin/bash" in some of the chroot-hooks to prevent spawning unnecessery bash shells
       + Added option to change the work directory from GUI
       + Added check if another instance of the GUI is already running to prevent double-chrooting and other issues
       + Added missing import of "Functions.sh" in the "QEMU.sh" and "Update.sh" script to report errors properly
       + Added comments in the main configuration file
